### A Note on Judgment

Judgment, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is the ability to make considered decisions or form sensible opinions. As a FOP leader, judgment is one of your most prized and powerful skills in the woods. While the above policies and procedures are designed to help you manage risk, developing judgment and sound decision-making are essential to your growth as a leader. The experiences that you bring the program, as well as the training you will receive, will nurture your ability to reason and use judgment to lead a safe, productive and fun FOP trip.
