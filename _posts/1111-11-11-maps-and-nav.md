### Maps

FOP uses a variety of different maps, all of which have a few things in common. They are all topographic, representing 3 dimensional space in a 2 dimensional format.

#### In the Margins

- The title of the map and North are at the top of the map.
- The date the map was made and the date of revisions.
- Longitude and latitude.
- Adjacent quadrangles.
- Magnetic declination (the deviation of the compass reading from True North).
- The contour interval.
- The key (or legend) including descriptions of types of roads.
- A scale to determine mileage.

#### The Map Itself

In the center of the map you will find the representation of the terrain. Again, there are standard methods for recording the information. The maps we issue have a standard color code (which may not be the same for non-USFS maps):

- Black ink denotes man made objects (buildings, roads, trails, power lines, bridges, etc.)
- Blue ink denotes water features (streams, springs, seasonal streams, swamps, lakes, rivers.)
- White areas denote clearings.
- Green areas denote vegetation.
- Brown ink denotes elevation changes (contour lines).
- Purple ink denotes updates made since the map was made (based on aerial photographs).

#### Reading Contour Lines

Contour lines, as marked in brown ink, indicate a change in elevation. The vertical distance between two contour lines is the contour interval and is different for different maps. However, a few things are generally true about contour lines:

- Lines that are close together indicate steep slopes or cliffs.
- On gentler slopes, lines will be farther apart.
- At ridges, the lines will form a V or U pointing downhill.
- In valleys, the V will point uphill.
- Circles denote summits.

Refer often to your map. As a leader, you should know where you are at all times. Keep your map handy. It is wise to pull out the map in the morning and construct a mental picture of the terrain you will cover that day. Taking the time to orient yourself and your group will give everyone an idea of what's in store and will also reduce the number of times you have to answer the question "Do you know how far we've gone so far?" or "Do you know how much farther it is?" Knowing exactly where you are also becomes critical in an emergency situation. If a storm comes up or if you need to send out for help, knowing your exact location is essential.

#### Estimating Travel Time

For a group of hikers with loaded packs, the standard equation is:

- 2 miles per hour on flat ground
- Add 1 hour for every 1,000 feet up
- Add 1/2 hour for every 1,000 feet down

FOP Groups are generally slower than this. 1 mile per hour is a more conservative estimate for FOP.

### Getting Lost

One of the more disconcerting events occurring on a trip is the realization that you are lost. Getting confused about where you are is a common occurrence, and getting lost is the next step in a trajectory that may lead up to a condition called "Woods Shock." Woods Shock occurs when a person's ability to coordinate his/her mental map of what they should be seeing and experiencing is different from what they are seeing and experiencing, resulting in complete loss of spatial orientation. This confusion results in a severe loss of judgment.

As a FOP leader, you will get confused. What is important is taking the time to calmly reorient yourself before pushing on too far and getting lost. A whole psychology exists to explain how people get lost. With awareness, leaders may avoid the conditions that accelerate confusion and lead to a dangerous situation.

Leaders need to be aware of the idea of 'mental lock,' a psychological term explaining how our brains work against us in certain conditions. Humans are efficient meaning- making machines; able to create meaning from very few details. For instance, you only need to see a red tail behind a tree to visualize a fox standing behind a tree; we are able to create complete images from incomplete cues. Once we have a visualization of what is behind the tree, we get a mental lock on our visualization and seek information that will reinforce our assumption. We want to support our visualization, and may miss facts that could disprove our theory and allow us to see the truth. A mental lock takes energy to overcome.

A common occurrence among trip leaders is mentally locking in reference to working with a topo map. In the mountains it is easy to believe you are at one spot and then make the terrain fit the map. You see a large mountain on the topo map to your east, so you look to the east and where you expect to see a mountain you see a small group of hills. Remember, your mind wants to reinforce its mental lock. You think those hills might be the same as the mountain I am seeing on the map. This common occurrence is called "bending the map." You are trying to make it fit into your conception and in doing so, you are beginning to get lost.

The research on how people get lost is highlighted in Gonzales's article "Land of the Lost" (National Geographic Adventure, Nov./Dec. 2001). Being lost, according to Gonzales, is not based upon location, but upon a transformation. The hiker goes through stages:

1. Denial: In this first stage, you get confused and press on down the trail with growing urgency. You hike faster to get to a place that is recognizable. As you get more confused, you hike faster and more urgently, expecting to see a feature that will let you know where you are. If you expect to see a stream crossing and you haven't gotten to it yet, you walk faster, getting more anxious as you round bends in the trail that lead to no stream crossings.
2. Admitting you're lost and panicking: By this time you have hurriedly hiked far down the trail looking for landscape features which will allow you to figure out where you are - if you do not find the features, eventually you can no longer deny your lost-ness or great lost-itude. This usually results in a sense of panic.
3. In the third stage, you calm down and think of a plan. This is an important stage, because your thinking and judgment may now be deteriorated through fatigue, dehydration, feeling like a failure in front of the group, and the general discomfort of not knowing what to do. This stage is crucial because if your plan does not work, you go on to stage four.
4. Deterioration: In this stage, your plan has failed, potentially sending you into another cycle of panic. The environmental conditions added with the emotional conditions will most likely impact judgments in a negative manner. More "creative" or riskier options seem to suddenly make sense. Your mental and physical conditions pull each other down, as Gonzales states, "like two drowning swimmers."
5. The last stage is resignation. As you run out of options, you resign yourself to the fact that it will be all right to give up.

#### Getting Un-Lost

Do not rush ahead to figure out where you are; STOP and figure it out. If you have gotten severely lost, you have a few tasks - to find a place to stay put, make a good campsite, and prepare for a long stay. The seven-point checklist for survival used by the Air Force is as follows in order of necessity:

1. Positive mental attitude
2. Apply first-aid
3. Create a shelter
4. Build a fire (for warmth and signaling)
5. Signaling
6. Water
7. Food

People tend to think of food first and attitude last, but in a survival situation you need to be mentally healthy - attitude comes first!

Since FOP has route plans, and expected times of arrival - when you do not come out, people will come looking for you. Know that people will be searching for you. Your job is to keep people as safe as you can while making it easy for people to find you.
Rick Curtis, our friend and colleague at Princeton, offers these ideas for leaders who find themselves lost:

General guidelines for getting un-lost:

- Identify your last know position. Mark the current time, check with all group members about what they remember since that point, including landmarks, trail junctions, and signs.
- Determine how long it has been since your last known position. Subtract the time for any lunch or meal breaks to calculate your total hiking time since your last known position.
- Estimate your hiking speed and try to include time for ascents and descents.
- Using your last known position and the estimated elapsed hiking time; you should be able to determine how far you could have traveled - creating a radius of travel. Draw a circle with a slightly larger radius (to account for inaccuracies in your estimates) on your map. This represents the possible area that you are in. You may be able to eliminate certain possibilities based on the topography. For example, there may be obvious baselines such as rivers and roads. If you have not crossed these, then at least you know where you have not been. Systematic elimination of where you aren't helps identify where you are.
- Look for any major landmarks or terrain features around you. See if you can locate those features on the map. With the map orientated, you may be able to determine a rough location with respect to local landmarks. It's essential that you be sure about you landmarks - do not force the landmarks to fit the map.
- If you can identify two landmarks, you should be able to find out your location using a compass and triangulation.

#### Staying Found

##### In Camp

One of the more dangerous ways people get lost is when they wander off from camp and are unable to find their way back. When a FOP group gets into camp, look around at the landmarks. Point out to everyone in the group where you are and encourage them to stay found - getting lost is almost always a symptom of under- estimating the woods and overestimating yourself. Pointing out landmarks that will help people return from a hike with the trowel to make a "long distance telephone call" will greatly help your FOPpers to stay found.

##### Hiking

While hiking, staying found is a product of using time control plans. With your route plan, develop expectations. When your time or the physical features do not conform to expectations - figure out what happened.

Leave camp early each day so you have the time to get "confused" and get "unconfused." Late groups put themselves in situations where everything needs to go perfectly, adding pressure to a situation. Groups that need to rest should do so after getting to camp, not before leaving camp as a general rule.

Knowing where you are on the map at all times is a habitual behavior that leaders need to develop. Look ahead of the map and see what features you will come across. Look to a feature like a stream crossing and when you get to the stream, take the map out and create another expectation. Many mistakes occur when map reading and "sense making" is taken for granted. Humans have a dangerous capacity for the illusion of being oriented to the land.
