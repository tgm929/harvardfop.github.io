Managing the risks of travel is the focus of FOP leaders. Leaders are expected to manage risks on their trips by following the policies and procedures outlined in the handbook and by instructing FOPpers in correct procedures. Safe practices require constant vigilance. It is virtually impossible to enumerate a complete set of "rules" to deal with all such situations that may arise. These policies are FOP's best guidelines, meant to inform the leader on expectations for how a trip will be lead. Leaders may need to ignore policies in certain rare but specific instances when the best decision for the group and/or an individual requires deviations from policy. Leaders should follow all policies, but not lose sight of the overall goal of caring for the group.

The policies and procedures in this section have been chosen by FOP to make the job of managing risks easier- or at least a bit clearer. Make sure you know the difference between a policy and a procedure.

***Policies*** are the rules of FOP. Internalize them and be familiar with the arguments that surround them, because even though you may not follow them in your everyday hiking regimen, they must become paramount when you are representing FOP.

***Procedures*** are more loose statements that may further explain the validity of a policy or provide more specific examples of how a policy may be implemented.

As an ethical question, FOP has prioritized the following four conditions with regards to its activities:

1. Preservation of life
2. Prevention of permanent disability, either physical or psychological 
3. Individuals are not worse off for having participated.
4. Participants have a positive experience.

As a general guideline, policies are only to be broken in order to ensure the first or second conditions (that is, preservation of life or prevention of permanent disability). Policies should not be broken to merely ensure that a participant has fun. Procedures are slightly more flexible, allowing that procedures could be broken to ensure any of these four conditions. In other words, it is slightly more possible that situations arise where a procedure could be broken than a policy. It is worth pointing out, though, that procedures should only be broken to ensure the preservation of these four conditions; "I prefer to do it another way" would be an insufficient reason. Finally, please bear in mind that this structure is provided only to aid you in decision making, not as absolute rule.

### Alcohol and Illegal Drugs

#### Definition

*Drug/alcohol activity* is defined as the use of alcohol, illegal drugs, prescription drugs taken without a prescription, the misuse of any prescription or non-prescription drug, or facilitating FOPpers' exposure to alcohol or drugs. This includes and is not limited to:

- Aiding in the purchase of alcohol/drugs for FOPpers
- Giving advice on how to obtain fake identification
- Inviting FOPpers to parties where alcohol/drugs are being served

#### Policy

- Alcohol or illegal drugs are not permitted on FOP.
- FOP leaders are not permitted to initiate or introduce any drug/alcohol activity with one of their FOPpers or a group of FOPpers.

#### Procedure

- It is important to note that FOP leadership occurs directly on the week-long trip, but your responsibility to your FOPpers continues for the rest of their first year at Harvard. The impact you have on your FOPpers is much greater than most leaders ever realize, and because of this, it is important to think seriously about how you conduct yourself with and around your FOPpers during their freshman year. FOP leaders are expected to be role models and to act responsibly in the presence of their FOPpers throughout the year.


### Animal Encounter Avoidance

#### Procedure

- Hang all food, garbage and toiletries every night in order both to keep food safe from animals and also to minimize animals' attachment to humans.
- Hang food, garbage and toiletries downwind from camp and keep the fueling station away from camp.
- Do not cause environmental damage in the process of finding a site or hanging food.

### Canoeing 

#### Policy

- The rescue boat must always be the first on and last off the water.
- Canoe only on designated bodies of water listed on the route plan.
- Night paddling is not allowed.
- Appropriate personal flotation devices (PFDs) and appropriate footwear must be worn and securely fastened at all times.

#### Procedure

- Distribute group equipment throughout multiple canoes, especially crucial items such as tarps, stoves, and fuel.
- Stay as close to shore as is reasonable, keeping the group between the closest shore and the leader canoe.
- Do not canoe in prohibitively rough or dangerous weather.
- Kneel when performing a crossing.

### Communication

#### Policy
 
- Each FOP trip will carry a cell phone and a personal locator beacon (PLB).
- The cell phone and the PLB are to be carried in the First Aid kit. 
- In the event the cell phone is used, you should first attempt to contact basecamp by following the explicit instructions on the Emergency Contact Sheet provided in your leader packet.

#### Procedure

- When calling basecamp from a cell or pay phone, the very first words spoken should be either "red light", "yellow light", or "green light", depending on the severity of the situation.
- The PLB is your last resort, for use when all other means of self-rescue have been exhausted, and only when the situation is grave and imminent. Use in loss of life or limb situations. Use your judgment. Use the PLB only if BOTH of these two conditions are met: 
    - It is a "red light" situation AND
    - you are unable to speak verbally with the director by cell phone. Use if the follow-up call after texting does not go through. 
- Neither the cell phone nor the PLB should impede the completion of necessary tasks in an emergency.
- Contingency plans should be created to function with AND without cell phone access.

Cell phones and PLBs have the potential to be extremely useful tools in this setting, but it is important that you understand some of the responsibilities associated with using these forms of communication in the wilderness. There is a strong chance that the cell phone will not work, and it may take some time for a rescue to be initiated with a PLB. FOP expects you to be able to manage an emergency with or without external communication. These technological tools are not a replacement for training and preparation.

### Environmental Awareness

#### Policy

- Always act to minimize your impact on the environment, including noise impact.

#### Procedure

- Leaders will be aware of environmental threats from the weather to local wildlife to the hazards of the terrain and be able to promote principles of risk management and accident prevention.

### Fires

#### Policy

- Fires are not encouraged, but permitted, only if ALL of the following conditions are met:
   - Leaders know that fires are allowed in the area that they are camping.
   - There is an established fire ring or the ability to make a LNT fire.
   - Small down wood or driftwood, rather than fresh branches, are used, and are collected over a wide area to minimize impact
   - Water is nearby and plentiful enough to extinguish a fire. Area is clear of flammable material, including fuel, stoves, synthetic materials, etc.
   - Leaders supervise the fire from lighting until it is completely extinguished.
- While on campus, open flames will only be used in designated areas with means available to extinguish a fire.
- No open flames are permitted in indoor spaces.
- Leaders will be aware of the fire plan of any building in which they are staying.

#### Procedure

- Fires meeting the above criteria are permissible for use in the backcountry for safety. Fires can be used in the front country on trips for which FOP has previously arranged a supply of wood.
- Fuel is never to be used to help start a fire.

### First Aid 

#### Policy
 
- Leaders must have current certification in Wilderness First Aid and CPR (or equivalent certifications) or above.
- Leaders will always have a first aid kit with them when leading a group.

### Footwear 

#### Policy

- Appropriate footwear must be worn at all times, including while swimming, canoeing, crossing streams and in camp.

#### Procedure

- Footwear must be close-fitting, secure and supportive to protect against rolled ankles and blisters.
- Footwear must have full coverage including a hard closed toe to protect against burns from spilled boiling water, lacerations from sticks and stones, and stubbed toes from exposure.
- One pair of shoes should generally be kept dry to decrease risk of discomfort, blisters and immersion foot (a.k.a. "trenchfoot").

### Hiking 

#### Policy

- An up-to-date route plan will be completed and be on file in the FOP office or with basecamp before any trip.
- FOP groups should always stay together. Only if there is an evacuation is it acceptable for a group to split up. In such an instance, hiking groups should have a minimum of three people.
- If the group does split up, only one group moves; the other remains stationary.

#### Procedure

- Night hiking is strongly discouraged.

### Hitchhiking

#### Procedure

- Do not hitchhike.
- In the event of a time-sensitive medical emergency, consider all means necessary to get help. Hitchhiking should not be used for matters of sheer convenience.

### Initiatives and Trust Activities

#### Policy

- A leader will be present during any initiative or trust activities.
- Spotting is required for any activity that warrants it. Traditionally, this means any rigorous activity on or off the ground.
- A leader will explain all guidelines and restrictions (head never below waist, etc.) and will stop any activity that is endangering the safety of a participant (no overstraining, diving headfirst, etc.).
- Leaders will assess the area for the initiative or trust activity to make sure it is appropriately free of hazards (i.e., roots, rocks, loose branches in trees, traffic, etc.).

#### Procedure

FOP spotting guidelines:

- The first priority in spotting is to protect the head, neck, and spinal cord. For this reason it is important to make sure the head is never below the feet.
- Maintain an appropriate position for the activity. Be ready to move at any time.
- Anticipate the possibility of a fall.
- Stay close to the participant, by do not interfere with her/his movements unless assistance is needed.
- Spotters need to stay focused on the individual they are spotting.
- Keep fingers and hands in the appropriate positions.
- Use specific communication between spotters and participants to begin and end an activity.

### Interaction with Strangers and Other Groups

#### Procedure

- Meet with the leaders of any FOP trip you will be interacting with to discuss your trips and decide on a manner of interaction that is comfortable for all involved.
- When interacting with strangers, Be cordial, but vague, about your trip plans. Do not advertise, but do not hide, that you are a Harvard orientation program. Don't tell strangers where you're going and don't give out personal information.

### Lightning

#### Procedure

- If there is a risk of lightning or if thunder can be heard, there is no substitute for seeking a low-risk location:
   - Low, rolling terrain
   - Away from water and where water might flow
   - Relatively uniform ground-cover that is reasonably taller than humans.
- If a low-risk location cannot be sought, a last-resort option for reducing the risks of lightning is to assume the lightning position:
   - Group spreads out (~30 feet between each individual) but communication lines are open.
   - Leaders should be separated.
   - Body position is either squatting with feet together or keeling with knees and feet together.
   - Individuals positioned on top of a pack, or other insulating material if a pack is not accessible.
- In a low-risk location, the lightning position is not mandated, but it is still a
tool if deemed necessary.
- Always keep in mind the risk of hypothermia in lightning situations.

### Motor Vehicles

#### Definition

*FOP vehicles* are defined as vehicles whose use FOP organizes for the purpose of transporting persons to FOP-related events.

#### Policy

- Drivers of FOP vehicles must be 21 years or older.
- Drivers of FOP vehicles must meet the Driver Eligibility Requirements.
- All FOP vehicles must be adequately insured, according to Harvard standards. Seat belts must be worn at all times by all vehicle occupants, with the exception of buses in which seat belts are unavailable.
- No FOP participant, leader, employee, or volunteer will travel in the cargo compartment of any vehicle, including and not limited to pick-up truck beds.
- Drivers of FOP vehicles must follow all state and federal road laws.
- Drivers of FOP vehicles will not text message while driving.
- Alcohol is not to be transported in FOP vehicles.

#### Procedure

- If you are tired and there is any chance of you falling asleep, DO NOT DRIVE.
- Cell phone use is discouraged while driving. Drivers should pull over to the side of the road if they need to place or receive a call.
- Fifteen and twelve passenger vans have been reported to have high rates of rollovers and should not be used to transport FOPpers or FOP leaders.
- Do not pick up hitchhikers.
- Have someone get out of the vehicle and help direct the driver when backing up or driving in a tight spot.
- Do not drive or move a vehicle when there is anyone within 10 feet of it.

### Pranks

#### Procedure

- Pranks are strongly discouraged on FOP. Pranks can escalate and can disturb both trust and safety within a group.

### Road Crossing

#### Procedure

- Do not linger by roads. Several accidents that have occurred on outdoor trips have resulted from cars. Cross quickly and don't linger.
- Scout out the best place to cross; you should have at least 200 feet of visibility in either direction. If you cannot see that far, post a leader as a spotter to let the group know if it is safe to cross. This procedure is particularly important if the road is curved.
- Line up along the side of the road and cross quickly as a group, all at once, with a leader on each end.
-If you must walk along a road, walk single file on the side that faces the traffic. 

### Sexual Activity 

#### Policy

- No sexual activity is permitted on FOP.
- Sexual/romantic relationships between leaders/staff and participants are forbidden. This extends after the conclusion of a FOP trip.

### Shelters/Huts

#### Procedure

- As a general rule, do not use available huts and shelters. Our land use permits specify shelter use should be limited to emergencies. If you judge it necessary to sleep in a shelter or use other resources that are available, set up both tarps in a nearby, designated spot, wait until it is late in the day to occupy the shelter, and be ready to yield your place in the shelter if a through hiker arrives.
- Both tarps should be set up every night to help ensure that FOPpers stay dry.
- Be courteous and respectful of other people using the trail and its facilities. FOP groups are large, and can be loud, so practice minimum noise impact.
- Do not camp in illegal campsites.

### Simulations

#### Policy

- Simulations will not used on fall orientation FOP trips
- Leader-trainees will be notified of the use of simulations on training trips.
- Simulations must be thoughtfully planned and executed in order to avoid unnecessarily risking the emotional or physical safety of anyone in the group. 
- A word or signal will be established to let people know, from the start, the nature of a situation; for example, "Real world" may denote a real situation while "Sim" may signal a simulation.

#### Procedure

- Simulations are used during leader training.
- Only leaders act as patients/primary participants in simulations. 
- Simulations are reviewed in a timely fashion.
- Simulations begin and end at distinct times.

### Smoking/Tobacco

#### Policy

- There is no tobacco use permitted on FOP.

### Solo Hiking

#### Policy

- Solo hikes can only be carried out in the following conditions. If any of these conditions are not met, the FOP trip cannot perform a solo hike:
   - No group member has a medical condition that could result in a change from that person's normal state.
   - Nobody in the group has an allergy or medical condition that would put that person in danger if alone.
   - The weather poses minimal risk to group safety or morale.
   - Participants have previously experienced similar terrain and leaders have assessed all participants as being capable of comfortable independent movement along the proposed route.
   - The trail is clearly marked.
   - Nobody in the group is overly tired, feeling emotionally detached or dis-heartened, or having difficulty hiking.
- The solo hike must be carried out in a specific manner to minimize the risk of people becoming lost or injured. FOP trip participants are never allowed to simply hike alone in an unstructured manner:
   - One leader is in the sweep and one in the lead position so that participants are sandwiched between leaders.
   - Participants are separated by short, regular intervals so that they are able to communicate verbally with the person immediately in front and behind them.
   - The solo hike only runs for a specified amount of time or distance so that the leader in front knows when to stop and regroup.
   - At any junction or detour the leader must stop and wait to regroup.- Participants must not deviate from the established trail.

### Stoves/Fuel 

#### Policy

- While on campus, stoves are to be used in designated areas only.

#### Procedure

- Stove use should always be supervised by a leader.
- Fueling of stoves and storage of fuel bottles should take place at least 50 feet from the cooking area and any bodies of water.
- Always stay on your feet when lighting a stove.
- Roll up your sleeves when lighting a stove.
- Stoves should be carried upright and depressurized in packs, in separate compartments from food, and ideally in different packs than the food to prevent fuel contamination.
- Fuel should be stored in a secure area while on campus 
- Leaders should avoid cooking on picnic tables.

### Stream Crossing

#### Procedure

- During significant stream crossings, backpack sternum straps and hip-belts should be unbuckled.
- Take into account whether or not to change into camp shoes for the crossing.
- Scout for the best/safest place to cross. Don't be afraid to venture up and down the stream to check all available options, and remember that there is always another time or place to cross a stream.
- Be aware of downstream hazards, such as logs, waterfalls, rapids, drops, etc.
- Think about various options: handing packs across, spotting, tripods, etc.

### Supervision 

#### Policy

- Participants are briefed on the trip itinerary before commencing.
- Participants are given all appropriate information about the area in which they will be traveling.
- Participants know where the staff will be located.
- The group travels together under the supervision of FOP leaders/staff.
- If a group needs to separate, a FOP leader/staff person accompanies each group.
- With the exception of certain situations (e.g. bathroom breaks, while sleeping, etc.) a leader will typically have visual contact with the participants.
- During normal group activities, the leader-to-participant ratios should not exceed 8:1.

#### Procedure

- Participants should be instructed about appropriate behavior should they become unexpectedly separated from their group.

### Swimming 

#### Definition

- **Wading**: walking in water that is less than or equal to mid-thigh deep for the participant.
- **Dipping**: sitting, dunking, and splashing in water that is less than or equal to mid-thigh deep for the participant.
- **Swimming**: entering water that is deeper than mid-thigh.

#### Policy

- A leader will supervise all wading, dipping, and swimming activity from shore. Appropriate footwear must be worn while wading, dipping, or swimming.
- Leaders will designate a swim/dip/wade area with boundaries AND leaders will check this area for dangers such as rocks, sudden drop-offs, logs, broken glass, fishhooks, etc. before participants are allowed to enter the water.
- In order to engage in swimming activities, a FOP group must meet all of the following conditions:
   - A leader/staff person with American Red Cross Lifeguard certification or comparable training must act as lifeguard for any swimming activity.
   - All FOPpers who are going to swim must first have their swimming ability tested and approved by a leader.
- The following activities water-related activities are NEVER allowed:
   - Swimming, dipping, or wading at night. 
   - Swimming in water colder than 60F.
   - Diving.
   - Swimming in moving water.
   - Swimming, dipping, or wading while alone.
   - Swimming in water that is deeper that the participant's chest.

| Are we allowed to             | Wade?     | Dip?  | Swim?     |
|------------------------------ |-------    |------ |-------    |
| A lifeguard is present        | Yes       | Yes   | Yes       |
| No lifeguard is present       | Yes       | Yes   | No        |

#### Procedure

- The lifeguard and an additional leader stay on shore to observe the swimmers. 
- A buddy system is developed for the FOPpers who will be in the water.
- Any FOPper who cannot follow the FOP swimming policy is removed from the activity.
- A rescue tube can be devised using an ensolite pad wrapped in webbing.
